# Getting Started
Make sure you have node installed: you can check that by running the command 'node -v' in your terminal. Version 10 and above should do.

In the project directory, you have to run:
## `npm install`
this will fetch all the packages/modules I have use to build this project.
## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it locally on your machine.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Items are displayed by a reusable component so where more Items are added, the item list increments.
